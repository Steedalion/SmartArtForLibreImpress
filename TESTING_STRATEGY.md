# Testing Strategy for LibreImpress SmartArt

Testing runs in **three automated layers** plus a small residue of genuinely
manual checks. Every layer runs in CI (`.github/workflows/build-and-validate.yml`)
on each push; layers 1–3 also run locally.

| Layer | What it proves | Needs LibreOffice? | Where |
|-------|----------------|--------------------|-------|
| 1. Java unit tests | Pure-Java logic (the parser) is correct | No | `mvn package` |
| 2. OXT structure validation | The `.oxt` contains the right files in the right places | No | CI shell step |
| 3. Runtime checks (registration/dispatch + drawing API) | LibreOffice loads the component, the command dispatches, and the drawing API behaves as assumed | Yes (headless) | `uno-tests/run.sh` |
| 3b. End-to-end render through the Java pipeline | The shipped parser → layout → `SlideRenderer` code actually draws every diagram type | Yes (headless) | `uno-tests/run.sh` |
| Manual | The dialog *looks* right on screen | Yes (GUI) | human |

The key change from earlier phases: **layer 3 is now automated.** A headless
LibreOffice plus python-UNO can assert that the extension registers *and* that the
menu command resolves to a dispatch — the exact failure that a wrong component
namespace, a bad identifier, or a mis-placed jar produces. Only the visual
appearance of the dialog still needs a human.

## Layer 1 — Java unit tests (fast, no LibreOffice)

**Location:** `src/test/java/.../parsers/HierarchyParserTest.java`

Tests the UNO-free core — the hierarchy parser and its validation (indentation
style, first-line rule, aligned widths, ≥3 nodes, ≥3 levels) and the outline
renderer. Pure Java, so it runs in plain Maven.

```bash
mvn clean package        # runs these during the test phase
```

As later phases add UNO-free logic (palette parsing, layout maths), put it behind
a plain class and unit-test it here.

---

## Layer 2 — OXT structure validation (no LibreOffice)

A shell step in CI asserts the built `.oxt` contains every required file and that
the fragile strings are correct, without launching LibreOffice:

- required entries present: `META-INF/manifest.xml`, `description.xml`,
  `Addons.xcu`, `ProtocolHandler.xcu`, `uno/SmartArtImpl.xml`, `uno/smartart.jar`;
- `uno/SmartArtImpl.xml` uses the `http://openoffice.org/2010/uno-components`
  namespace;
- `description.xml` declares `<identifier value="org.libreimpress.smartart"/>`.

These are cheap regression guards for the registration contract
(`docs/plans/Phase2_ImplementationPlan.md` §15), but they **cannot** prove the extension
actually works — that is layer 3.

---

## Layer 3 — Runtime checks against a headless LibreOffice

**Scripts:** `uno-tests/run.sh` (orchestrator) + the probes in `uno-tests/probes/`.
See [`uno-tests/README.md`](uno-tests/README.md). `run.sh` starts a throwaway,
headless LibreOffice (profile under `target/`, never `/tmp`), optionally installs
the `.oxt`, runs the given probe over a UNO socket, and tears everything down.

Three probes gate CI:

**`registration_probe.py`** (installs the `.oxt`) asserts:
1. the SmartArt menu item is present in LibreOffice's **merged** Addons config; and
2. `frame.queryDispatch("org.libreimpress.smartart:CreateDiagram", …)` returns a
   real dispatch in an Impress frame.

Check 2 is the decisive one: LibreOffice **silently hides** an addon menu item
whose command cannot be dispatched, so a null dispatch means an empty submenu.
This catches the registration/dispatch regressions that layers 1–2 miss — e.g.
the component jar packaged at the OXT root instead of `uno/smartart.jar`, which
leaves the config perfect but the dispatch null (see `docs/plans/Phase2_ImplementationPlan.md`
§15).

**`render_probe.py`** (no extension needed) exercises the drawing API the renderer
relies on against a fresh Impress doc — create `RectangleShape`s, glue
`ConnectorShape`s, group via the global `ShapeCollection` — guarding against a
LibreOffice version where any of those behaves differently (each was a real
surprise during development). It is an API-contract smoke test; it does not invoke
the Java renderer (that needs the modal dialog, which can't run headless).

**`e2e_demo_probe.py`** (installs the `.oxt`) is the true end-to-end check: it
dispatches `org.libreimpress.smartart:Demo` with an `OutputDir` argument, which
runs the extension's **real** `HierarchyParser` → `LayoutFactory` →
`SlideRenderer` for every diagram type (the same code path as the dialog's
Create button, minus the dialog itself). It then asserts one grouped diagram
per type on its own slide with the expected node texts, a 1280-wide
aspect-correct non-blank PNG per type, and an `OK` line per type in the
`demo-result.txt` that
`DemoRunner` writes in headless mode. A failure here means the shipped Java
code is broken — closing the gap the render probe leaves open.

```bash
# requires libreoffice (unopkg, soffice) + python3-uno on PATH
mvn clean package
uno-tests/run.sh --install target/SmartArt.oxt uno-tests/probes/registration_probe.py
uno-tests/run.sh uno-tests/probes/render_probe.py
uno-tests/run.sh --install target/SmartArt.oxt uno-tests/probes/e2e_demo_probe.py
#   … PASS lines …
#   UNO TEST PASS: <probe>
```

Each run exits non-zero on failure, so they gate CI. The registration probe was
validated both ways: it passes on a correct build and **fails** on a deliberately
broken one (jar moved to the OXT root → `queryDispatch` returns `None`).

---

## What still must be manual

Only the **visual appearance and interaction** of the dialog:

- dialog layout / control sizing on screen;
- that Create echoes the parsed tree and Cancel does nothing;
- how the rendered diagrams *look* (geometry/text presence is asserted by
  `e2e_demo_probe.py`; aesthetics still need eyes).

Everything up to and including "the shipped Java pipeline draws every diagram
type" is automated; what the human still confirms is dialog interaction and
visual quality.

Manual smoke test:
```bash
unopkg remove org.libreimpress.smartart            # ignore "not found" the first time
unopkg add --suppress-license target/SmartArt.oxt  # close all LibreOffice windows first
# Impress → SmartArt → Create Diagram… → type a 3-level outline → Create
```

## CI summary

`.github/workflows/build-and-validate.yml` on every push:

1. `mvn clean package` — layer 1 + build the `.oxt`.
2. Validate OXT structure — layer 2.
3. Install LibreOffice + `python3-uno`, then run both `uno-tests/` probes under
   `xvfb-run` — layer 3.
4. Upload the `.oxt` artifact.
